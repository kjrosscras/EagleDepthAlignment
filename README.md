Replace distorted timestamped JPEG with your own. Update undstort.py with your image name then run. 

Replace calib.json , recalculate_pose , and add your own recalculate_result.las.

Update export_images.py configuration with your own file names.

Run export_images.py

Have to change the orientation and flip the image, so I'm definitely doing something wrong.
